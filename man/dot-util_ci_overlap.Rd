\title{Regression confidence interval overlap for one synthetic data replicate}
\usage{
.util_ci_overlap(synth_data, conf_data, formula)
}
\arguments{
\item{synth_data}{A data.frame with synthetic data}

\item{conf_data}{A data.frame with the confidential data}

\item{formula}{A formula for a linear regression model}
}
\value{
A list of two dataframes:
\itemize{
\item \code{ci_overlap}: one row per model parameter with utility metrics.
\itemize{
\item \code{overlap }: symmetric overlap metric, calculated as the average of the
interval overlap contained in the synthetic confidence interval and the
interval overlap contained in the confidential confidence interval.
\item \code{coef_diff}: synthetic parameter estimate - confidential parameter estimate
\item \code{std_coef_diff}: \code{coef_diff} divided by the standard error for the confidential data.
\item \code{sign_match}: boolean if the synthetic and confidential parameter estimates have the same sign.
\item \code{significance_match}: boolean if the null hypothesis test where the
parameter is 0 has p-value less than .05 agrees in both confidential and
synthetic data.
\item \code{ss}: boolean if both \code{sign_match} and \code{significance_match} are true.
\item \code{sso}: boolean if \code{sign_match} is true and \code{overlap} is positive.
}
\item \code{coef_diff}: one row per model parameter and data source (confidential or
synthetic) listing parameter estimates, standard errors, test statistics,
p-values for null hypothesis tests, and 95\% confidence interval bounds.
